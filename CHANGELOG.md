
 * Upgrade presets for FFmpeg 2.3
 * Make the `cppbuild.sh` scripts install native libraries inside the `cppbuild` subdirectories, instead of on the system
 * Include new `platform.dependency` and `platform.dependencies` properties to let users depend easily on the artifacts that contain native libraries
 * Add presets for FFTW 3.3.4, GSL 1.16, LLVM 3.4.2
 * Fix missing `static` keyword on methods annotated with an `@Adapter` ([issue #3](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/issues/3))
 * Turn `Mat.createFrom()` into a static factory method, and make `Mat.copyFrom()` call `Mat.create()` as appropriate ([issue #1](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/issues/1))
 * Add missing `native_camera` modules of `opencv_highgui` for Android
 * Fix functions from `opencv_stitching` not accepting a `MatVector` as apparently intended by the API (issue javacv:466)

### April 28, 2014 version 0.8
 * Move from Google Code to GitHub as main source code repository
 * Rename the `com.googlecode.javacpp` package to `org.bytedeco.javacpp`
 * Appended the version of the parent artifact to the ones of the child modules, in an effort to avoid conflicts
 * Updated `cppbuild.sh` scripts with support for the "android-x86" platform (issue javacv:411), thanks to Xavier Hallade
 * Added presets for PGR FlyCapture 1.7
 * Fixed compilation errors on Android, Mac OS X, and Windows
 * Upgraded to OpenCV 2.4.9, FFmpeg 2.2.1, libdc1394 2.2.2, and libfreenect 0.4
 * Introduced build scripts, based on the CPPJARs package of JavaCV, to install native C/C++ libraries
 * Ported various helper classes and methods from JavaCV
 * Inserted missing dependency entries in the `pom.xml` files of the child modules
 * Added presets for the C++ API of OpenCV 2.4.8, which can now be parsed due to the latest changes in JavaCPP

### January 6, 2014 version 0.7
 * Fixed JavaCPP properties not getting set by the parent `pom.xml` file
 * Added presets for the C API of OpenCV 2.4.8, FFmpeg 2.1.x, libfreenect 0.2 (OpenKinect), videoInput 0.200, and ARToolkitPlus 2.3.0
